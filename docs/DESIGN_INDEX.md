# DESIGN_INDEX — Stitch screens ⇆ wired routes ⇆ navigation

**Purpose:** the single economical lookup for "which Stitch screen is which, where
it lives in code, and how you reach it." Built to stop wiring/auditing *by
association*. Source of truth for a screen's look is always its
`design/screens/<folder>/screen.png` (+ `code.html`), never the folder name — a
name/content mismatch has happened before (see `CLAUDE.md`).

Status legend:
- ✅ **wired + verified faithful this session**
- 🔵 **wired** (exists as a real route; visual fidelity per prior sessions, not re-diffed here)
- 🟠 **wired but static/stub** (UI only, no real backend/persistence, or an orphan with no inbound link)
- ⚪ **not wired — correctly deferred** (Phase 2/3 per `PRD.md` §4)
- 🔴 **not wired — Phase-1 gap** (belongs in the current MVP but has no route)
- ➕ **wired, no source in the 42-screen export** (designed fresh or from a later export)

## 1. Screen index (42 Stitch screens → routes)

Mobile folders are the responsive variant of the same screen and share the route.

|---|--------|------------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 22 | Landing Page | `guest_landing_page_desktop_1/2`, `guest_landing_page_mobile` | — (`/` just redirects to `/gallery-entry`) | 🔴 gap | 1 |

### Marketing
| # | Screen | Stitch folder(s) | Wired route | Status | Phase |

| 42 | Digital Brochure | `digital_brochure` | — | ⚪ | 3 |

### ➕ Wired routes with NO source in the 42-screen export
| Route | Origin | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `/consent` | designed fresh | biometric-consent gate; `CLAUDE.md` flagged it missing from the export |
| `/selfie` | later Stitch export | brought in during Stage 2 face-matching |
| `/join` | orphan | early code-entry screen, superseded by `/gallery-entry`; no inbound link |
| `/login` `/signup` `/forgot-password` `/reset-password` | auth screens | not part of the 42-screen product export |

## 2. Navigation / linking map (what button goes where)

Derived from actual `href` / `router.push` / `redirect` in `apps/web/app`, not memory.

### Guest flow
```
/  ──redirect──▶  /gallery-entry
/gallery-entry  ──enter or scan code──▶  /consent
/consent  ──accept──▶ /selfie      ──decline/skip──▶ /gallery      ──no token──▶ /gallery-entry
/selfie   ──complete/skip──▶ /gift-reveal   ──skip to gallery──▶ /gallery   ──error/no consent──▶ /consent
/gift-reveal  ──"view gallery" button──▶  /gallery
/gallery  ──(guards)──▶ /consent  or  /gallery-entry
```

### Photographer flow
```
/login   ──success──▶ /admin        links ▶ /forgot-password, /signup
/signup  ──success──▶ /admin        link  ▶ /login
/forgot-password ─▶ /login
/reset-password  ──success──▶ /admin   link ▶ /forgot-password

/admin (dashboard) ─▶ /admin/events, /admin/create-event
AdminShell sidebar:  לוח בקרה▶/admin   אירועים פעילים▶/admin/events
                     ⚠ DEAD (href:null): ארכיון אירועים · לקוחות VIP · ניתוח נתונים
                     header buttons ▶ /admin/create-event, /admin/branding

/admin/events ─▶ /admin/create-event, /admin/events/[event_id]
/admin/events/[event_id] ─▶ /admin/events            ⚠ does NOT link to QR management
/admin/create-event ──submit──▶ /admin/branding?event_id=…     link ▶ /admin
/admin/branding ──submit──▶ /admin/qr-management?event_id=…     links ▶ /admin, /admin/create-event
/admin/qr-management ─▶ /admin/events/[event_id], /admin/branding?event_id=…
```

**Key navigation gaps (real, in code today):**
- **QR management is a dead-end reachable only by re-running create→brand.** Nothing
  in the sidebar links to it, and the event-detail page (`/admin/events/[event_id]`)
  has no "view QR" link — so a photographer cannot re-open an existing event's QR
  without going through branding again.
- **Three dead sidebar links** (`ארכיון אירועים`, `לקוחות VIP`, `ניתוח נתונים`) render
  as non-navigating items — they map to Phase-2 screens (Statistics etc.) that aren't
  built yet.
- **Guest Landing Page (Stitch #22/#32) is not wired** — `/` redirects straight to
  `/gallery-entry`, so the designed landing screen never renders. Phase-1 gap.

## 3. QR-management finding (the one you flagged)

The wired `/admin/qr-management/page.tsx` **is a faithful port** of
`barcode_management_desktop/screen.png`: same success header (`האירוע נוצר בהצלחה!`),
QR-right / controls-left two-column layout, print dropdown, `הצגה על מסך מלא`,
`הורדה כקובץ PNG`, digital-share grid (WhatsApp green + Email/Telegram/Instagram),
direct-link box, `ID:` pill, and the `מעבר לניהול האירוע` / `עריכת פרטי הגלריה` footer.
The QR itself is a real scannable code generated client-side.

If it looks "totally different" **on the live site**, the likely cause is the
**documented deploy gap** (the Worker froze on an old build once before — see
`SUMMARY.md` 2026-07-06 and `MISTAKES.md`), i.e. the good code above was never
what shipped. This needs a live re-verify (deployed chunk hash vs. local build)
before assuming a code bug. One real code deviation vs. Stitch: the Stitch screen
uses a centered **top nav** (`גלריה · אירועים · הגדרות`); the wired page uses the
`AdminShell` sidebar instead.

## 4. Payment / commerce (why it should NOT exist yet)

There is **no payment/checkout/prints page anywhere on this branch** — no route, no
component, no Stripe reference. That is correct: `PRD.md` §4 puts **Checkout, Premium
Prints, and Order Confirmation in Phase 2** ("Stripe Billing + Checkout, Premium
Prints → Checkout → Order Confirmation, print-on-demand + commission ledger"). The
current milestone is finishing the Phase-1 MVP. Building the payment flow now would
jump ahead of the PRD; it should be driven by the Phase-2 kickoff, not by a passing
mention. Open Phase-2 questions that gate it: final ILS pricing, print-fulfillment
partner, and whether Stripe Connect is needed (`PRD.md` §8).
